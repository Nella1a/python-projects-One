I am currently learning Python. 
This is a collection of small projects including: 

- Scraping an e-commerce store using Selenium 

- Scraping realtime currency (JPY,USD) using BeautifulSoup

- Request news articles from news sources and blogs across the web via a news api

- Request weather forecast for the next 5 days via a weather api
